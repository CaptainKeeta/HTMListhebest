<h2>The Story</h2>
You are 'Frisk', a human who has fallen down into the underground, where the monsters that inhabited the earth alongside humans werebanished. You meet a wide variety of characters, and can choose to befreind them, or kill them in typical RPG fashion. 
Your goal is to escape the underground, by either helping everyone, hindering everyone, or doing a mix of both. It's up to you!<br><br>
